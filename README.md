## Introduction
This repository contains a project developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The project demonstrates the use of core OOP concepts like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and more, which are essential for developing modular, reusable, and maintainable software.

The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on example of how to apply OOP concepts in software development.

## Features
- **Modular Codebase**: Easily scalable and maintainable.
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and controlled access through methods.
- **Inheritance**: Code reuse through class hierarchies.
- **Polymorphism**: Flexibility in method behavior through method overriding and interfaces.
- **Abstraction**: Simplification of complex logic into abstract classes.

## Technologies
- **Language**: [Java / C++ / Python] (select your primary OOP language)
- **Framework**: If using any frameworks, list them here (e.g., Spring, Django, etc.)
- **IDE**: Mention your recommended IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode)

## OOP Concepts
This project implements the following OOP principles:
1. **Abstraction**: Breaking down complex systems into simpler models.
2. **Encapsulation**: Containing the internal state of objects within classes.
3. **Inheritance**: Extending existing classes to create specialized ones.
4. **Polymorphism**: Allowing methods to behave differently based on the object.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OOP-Development.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd OOP-Development
    ```

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment (if using Python):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

4. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python projects
    npm install  # For JavaScript-based OOP projects
    ```

## Usage
Once installed, you can run the project by:

- Running the main file (e.g., `Main.java`, `app.py`):
    ```bash
    java Main.java  # For Java
    python app.py  # For Python
    ```

- Testing different OOP features:
    - Experiment with inheritance by modifying the class hierarchy.
    - Try out method overriding for polymorphism.
    - Encapsulate new data fields within classes.
